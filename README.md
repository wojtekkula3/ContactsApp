#### What technologies was used?

For this project Android OS and Java language is used. The rows of all contacts are generated by **RecyclerView** and each row is made of cardview and linear leayout (which is recomended here in case of speed).<br><br>
The project use **MVVM Architecture** with **LiveData** which observe the data and their changes on the database. The MVVM data helps to separate the application logic from the user interface.<br> <br>
The use of **ROOM database** gives the posibility to work on the SQL queries and tables (in ROOM - entities) in which the contacts are stored. One of the adventages of Room is that the queries are validated while the program is compiled, moreover this library reduces the amount of boilerplate code.
